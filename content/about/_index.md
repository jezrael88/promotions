## About iEngtests

For 5 years, iEngtests has been proud to help our students pursue their test goals and track their progress from start to finish. Everything we offer - from guidance, to powerful exam tools, to educational resources - is built around one thing…you. Every day we’re driven to solve the world’s English exams using developed and applied strategies on the actual tests. 90% of our graduates improved their scores by 0.5 - 1.5 and go straight into employment or further study abroad. It is built by our trusted UK professionals from England and Wales, China and the Philippines.

We utilise a diverse and enriched curriculum to teach our learners to be familiarised with test formats and contents, effective methods, strategies and skill-building techniques with the subject they need to master. This also includes covering all the rules of the exam, providing mock tests, group activities, and language preparation tools following the Cambridge IELTS and Occupational English Test book formats.

Our tagline is ‘Your Success Is Our Success’ because our success solely depends on our attention to the needs of our students and truly helping them achieve - we don’t succeed unless they succeed. We also believe that “success” means more than just helping them achieve their desired marks but also to empower them to be more confident speakers and to provide a pathway to writing better quality essays that are of an academic standard and style. We selectively collaborate with tutors and organisations who share our priorities of creating a meaningful learning platform and of building a meaningful business.

In addition, we strive to nurture a culture of innovation and purpose within our company. Teaching iEngtests (International English Tests) is in our soul, and we exist to share that passion in every learner.
