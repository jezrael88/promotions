#### Non-personal information

This is information that is not associated with a specific personal identity. We collect and analyse web statistics using standard analysis technologies to better understand the high level profile and activity of visitors to the website. This helps us develop our content to suit market demands. We also use cookies on our web site. A cookie is a small, encrypted data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique user ID. A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your previous visits to this website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to this site and/or other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of personalised advertising by visiting Ads Settings. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. We only use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our website, track general user movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
